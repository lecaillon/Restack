# Restack
Restack is an easy to declare and inject, autogenerated proxy for an HTTP service. The idea is to make a full featured resilient HTTP client. It's inspired by the David Fowler's project [RestSample](https://github.com/davidfowl/RestSample) and forked from Ryan Nowak work on [Kickr](https://github.com/glennc/Kickr).

Its implementation is based on:
- [refit](https://github.com/paulcbetts/refit)
- [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)
- [consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul)
